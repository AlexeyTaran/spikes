# Telepresence Bot (tpbot)
This folder contains the code for our amazing telepresence bot.
The project includes the following units:
* **Remote control unit**: an Android sender app with the remote control UI which will send movement commands to a receiver Android app, installed in the bot device.
* **HW-SW bridge unit**: a serial channel between the receiver Android app and the movement unit. It will be included in the receiver App, once finished.
* **Movement unit**: Arduino-controlled motors connected to a frame holding the Adroid device
